Write a program to sort an array of 0's,1's and 2's in ascending order.
Using Dutch Partitioning. 
The loop invariant is that all points upto red pointer are already 0, 
from red to white pointer are 1,  and points from blue to end are 2s. 
We will run over the points between white and blue and assign them to each zone.

def sortColors(self, nums):
  red, white, blue = 0, 0, len(nums)-1    
  while white <= blue:
      # print(red, white, blue, nums)
      if nums[white] == 0:
          nums[red], nums[white] = nums[white], nums[red]
          white += 1
          red += 1
      elif nums[white] == 1:
          white += 1
      else:
          nums[white], nums[blue] = nums[blue], nums[white]
          blue -= 1
          
 #no return value - the function will update the list.
