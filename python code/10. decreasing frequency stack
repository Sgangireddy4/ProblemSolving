Print the elements of an array in the decreasing frequency if 2 numbers have same frequency then print the one which came first.

def decreasingFrequency(nums):
  counter = {}
  group = collections.defaultdict(list)
  for n in nums:
    counter[n] = counter.get(n,0)+1
  
  for n in nums:
    freq = counter[n]
    if n not in group[freq]: group[freq].append(n)
    
 output = []
 freqs = group.keys()
 freqs.sort(key =lambda x:-x)
 for freq in freqs:
    output.extend(group[freq])
 
 return output
